<p class="pmb2 caption2">&#9632; for the Home and Farmstead</p>



<p>You can save money and avoid
delays by making minor plumbing
repairs yourself.</p>

<p>Jobs that a farmer or homeowner
can do with a few basic
tools include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Repairing water faucets
and valves.</li>

<li>Repairing leaks in pipes
and tanks.</li>

<li>Thawing frozen pipes.</li>

<li>Repairing water closets.</li>

<li>Cleaning clogged drains.</li>

</ul>

<p>Extensive plumbing repairs or
alterations in the plumbing system usually require
authorization from local authorities and
possibly inspection of the completed work. Therefore such work
should be done by a qualified or
licensed plumber.</p>



<p class="caption2"><a id="REPAIRING_WATER_FAUCETS_AND_VALVES" name="REPAIRING_WATER_FAUCETS_AND_VALVES"></a>REPAIRING WATER FAUCETS AND VALVES</p>

<p>Faucets and globe valves, the
type of shutoff valves commonly
used in home water systems, are
very similar in construction (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) and repair instructions given
below apply to both. Your faucets or valves may differ somewhat
in general design from the one
shown in <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a>, because both
faucets and valves come in a wide
variety of styles.</p>

<p>Mixing faucets, which are
found on sinks, laundry trays,
and bathtubs, are actually two
separate units with a common
spout. Each unit is independently
repaired.</p>

<p>Dripping faucets are the most
common plumbing problem. Normally a new washer is all that is
required. If water leaks around the
stem, either the packing is loose or
needs replacing. To repair the
faucet, first shut off the water at
the shutoff valve nearest the particular faucet.</p>

<p>Disassemble the faucet by removing the handle, packing nut,
packing, and stem in that order.
You may have to set the handle
back on the stem and use it to unscrew and remove the stem.</p>

<p>Remove the screw and worn
washer from the stem. Clean the
washer cup and install a new
washer of the proper size and type.</p>

<p>Reassemble the faucet. Handles
of mixing faucets should be in
matched positions.</p>

<p>If a washer requires frequent
replacement, it may be the wrong
type or the seat may be rough and
scoring the washer. Flat washers
are used on seats having a crown
or round ridge for the washer seat.
Tapered or rounded washers are
used with tapered seats. These
seats may be replaced if worn or
damaged.</p>

<p>Replaceable seats have either a
square or hex shaped water passage for the seat removal tool. Seat
dressing tools are available for
non-replaceable seats.</p>

<p>Occasionally a faucet will be
noisy when water is flowing. This
may be due to a loose washer or
worn threads on the stem and receiver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"> 2 </a></span>
permitting the stem to vibrate or chatter. Pressing down on
the handle will stop stem vibration
but will not affect a loose washer.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 518px;">
<a id="fig1" name="fig1"></a>
<img src="images/fig1.png" width="518" height="430" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><i>Figure 1.</i>&mdash;Globe type angle valve. Faucets are similar in construction.</div>
</div>

<p>Replacement stems are available; however, if the receiving
threads are worn excessively a
new stem would not eliminate the
problem completely. In some
faucets it is possible to replace the
stem receiver, the stem, and the
seat, thus restoring all normal
wearing parts within the faucet.</p>

<p>Several new faucet designs
aimed at easier operation, eliminating drip, and promoting long
service life, are on the market.
Instructions for repair may be obtained from dealers.</p>

<p>If a shower head drips,
the supply valve has not been fully closed, or the valve needs repair.</p>

<p>After extended use and several
repairs, some valves will no longer give tight shutoff and must be
replaced. When this becomes necessary, it may be advisable to upgrade
the quality with equipment
having better flow characteristics
and longer-life design and materials. In some cases, ball valves
will deliver more water than
globe valves. Some globe valves
deliver more flow than others for
identical pipe sizes. Y-pattern
globe valves, in straight runs of
pipe, have better flow characteristics than straight stop valves.
<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> shows the features of
different types of valves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"> 3 </a></span></p>

</div>


<p class="caption2">PRECAUTIONS</p>


<p>Polluted water or sewage may
carry such diseases as typhoid
fever and amoebic dysentery. If
you do your own plumbing work,
be sure that&mdash;</p>

<ul>

<li>There are no leaks in drainpipes through which sewage or sewage
gases can escape.</li>

<li>There are no cross connections between piping carrying water from
different sources unless there can be reasonable certainty that all
sources are safe and will remain safe.</li>

<li>There can be no back siphonage of water from plumbing fixtures or
other containers into the water-supply system.</li>

</ul>

<p>Once a pipe has become polluted, it may be difficult to free it
of the pollution. For this reason,
building codes do not permit the
use of second-hand pipe. All initial piping and parts and
subsequent replacements should be
new.</p>

<p>Since a plumbing system will
require service from time to time,
shutoff valves should be installed
at strategic locations so that an
affected portion can be isolated
(water flow to it cut off) with
minimum disturbance to service
in the rest of the system. Shutoff
valves are usually provided on the
water closet supply line, on the
hot- and cold-water supply line
to each sink, tub, and lavatory,
and on the water heater supply
line. Drain valves are usually installed for water-supply piping
systems and for hot-water storage tanks.</p>

<p>A pressure-relief valve should
be installed for the water heater
storage tank to relieve pressure
buildup in case of overheating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"> 4 </a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 519px;">
<a id="fig3" name="fig3"></a>
<img src="images/fig3.png" width="519" height="579" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption"><i>Figure 3.</i>&mdash;Frostproof hydrant; <i>A</i>, Closed; <i>B</i>, opened. As soon as the hydrant is
closed, water left in the riser drains out the drain tube as shown in <i>A</i>. This
prevents water from freezing in the hydrant in cold weather.</span>
</div>



<hr class="chap" />
<p class="caption2"><a name="FROSTPROOF_HYDRANTS" id="FROSTPROOF_HYDRANTS">FROSTPROOF HYDRANTS</a></p>


<p>Frostproof hydrants are basically faucets, although they may
differ somewhat in design from
ordinary faucets.</p>

<p>Two important features of a
frostproof hydrant are: (1) The
valve is installed under ground&mdash;below the frostline&mdash;to prevent
freezing, and (2) the valve is designed to drain the water from
the hydrant when the valve is
closed.</p>

<p><a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> shows one type of
frostproof hydrant. It works as
follows: When the handle is raised, the piston rises, opening the
valve. Water flows from the supply pipe into the cylinder, up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"> 5 </a></span>
through the riser, and out the
spout. When the handle is pushed
down, the piston goes down, closing the valve and stopping the
flow of water. Water left in the
hydrant flows out the drain tube
into a small gravel-filled dry well
or drain pit.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 503px;">
<a id="fig4" name="fig4"></a>
<img src="images/fig4.png" width="503" height="438" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><i>Figure 4.</i>&mdash;Vacuum breaker arrangement for outside hose hydrant.</div>
</div>

<p>As with ordinary faucets, leakage will probably be the most
common trouble encountered with
frostproof hydrants. Worn packing, gaskets, and washers can
cause leakage. Disassemble the
hydrant as necessary to replace
or repair these and other parts.</p>

<p>Frostproof yard hydrants having buried drains can be health
hazards. The vacuum created by
water flowing from the hydrant
may draw in contaminated water
standing above the hydrant drain
level. Such hydrants should be
used only where positive drainage
can be provided.</p>

<p>Frostproof wall hydrants (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>) are the preferred type. For
servicing sprayers using hazardous chemicals, hydrants having
backflow protection should be
used (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>).</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="Pipes" name="Pipes"></a>Pipes</p>

<p>Leaks in pipes usually result
from corrosion or from damage
to the pipe. Pipes may be damaged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> 6 </a></span>
by freezing, by vibration
caused by machinery operating
nearby, by water hammer, or by
animals bumping into the pipe.
(Water hammer is discussed on
P. 8)</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><i>Figure 5.</i>&mdash;Protected wall hydrant suitable for filling agricultural sprayers.</div>
</div>

<p class="caption4"><i>Corrosion</i></p>

<p>Occasionally waters are encountered that corrode metal pipe
and tubing. (Some acid soils also
corrode metal pipe and tubing.)</p>

<p>The corrosion usually occurs, in
varying degrees, along the entire
length of pipe rather than at
some particular point. An exception would be where dissimilar
metals, such as copper and steel,
are joined.</p>

<p>Treatment of the water may
solve the problem of corrosion.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Otherwise, you may have to replace the piping with a type made
of material that will be less subject to the corrosive action of the
water.</p>

<p>It is good practice to get a
chemical analysis of the water
before selecting materials for a
plumbing system. Your State college or university may be
equipped to make an analysis; if not,
you can have it done by a private
laboratory.</p>

<p class="caption4"><i>Repairing Leaks</i></p>

<p>Pipes that are split by hard
freezing must be replaced.</p>

<p>A leak at a threaded connection can often be stopped by
unscrewing the fitting and applying a pipe joint compound that
will seal the joint when the fitting is screwed back together.</p>

<p>Small leaks in a pipe can often
be repaired with a rubber patch
and metal clamp or sleeve. This
must be considered as an emergency repair job and should be
followed by permanent repair as
soon as practicable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"> 7 </a></span></p>

<p>Large leaks in a pipe may require cutting out the damaged
section and installing a new piece
of pipe. At least one union will
be required unless the leak is near
the end of the pipe. You can make
a temporary repair with plastic
or rubber tubing. The tubing must
be strong enough to withstand
the normal water pressure in the
pipe. It should be slipped over the
open ends of the piping and fastened with pipe clamps or several
turns of wire.</p>

<p>Vibration sometimes breaks
solder joints in copper tubing,
causing leaks. If the joint is accessible, clean and resolder it.
The tubing must be dry before
it can be heated to soldering temperature. Leaks in places not
readily accessible usually require
the services of a plumber and
sometimes of both a plumber and
a carpenter.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Tanks" name="Tanks"></a>Tanks</p>

<p>Leaks in tanks are usually
caused by corrosion. Sometimes,
a safety valve may fail to open
and the pressure developed will
spring a leak.</p>

<p>While a leak may occur at only
one place in the tank wall, the
wall may also be corroded thin
in other places. Therefore, any
repair should be considered as
temporary, and the tank should
be replaced as soon as possible.</p>

<p>A leak can be temporarily repaired with a toggle bolt, rubber
gasket, and brass washer, as
shown in <a href="#fig6">figure 6</a>. You may have
to drill or ream the hole larger
to insert the toggle bolt. Draw
the bolt up tight to compress the
rubber gasket against the tank
wall.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="WATER_HAMMER" id="WATER_HAMMER">WATER HAMMER</a></p>


<p>Water hammer sometimes occurs when a faucet is suddenly
closed. When the flow of water
is suddenly stopped, its kinetic
energy is expended against the
walls of the piping. This causes
the piping to vibrate, and leaks
or other damage may result.</p>

<p>Water hammer may be prevented or its severity reduced by
installing an air chamber just
ahead of the faucet. The air chamber may be a piece of air-filled
pipe or tubing, about 2 feet long,
extending vertically from the
pipe. It must be airtight. Commercial devices designed to
prevent water hammer are also available.</p>

<p>An air chamber requires occasional replenishing of the air to
prevent it from becoming water-logged&mdash;that is, full of water
instead of air.</p>

<p>A properly operating hydropneumatic tank, such as the type
used in individual water systems,
serves as an air chamber, preventing or reducing water hammer.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="FROZEN_WATER_PIPES" id="FROZEN_WATER_PIPES">FROZEN WATER PIPES</a></p>


<p>In cold weather, water may
freeze in underground pipes laid
above the frostline or in pipes
in unheated buildings, in open
crawl spaces under buildings, or
in outside walls.</p>

<p>When water freezes it expands.
Unless a pipe can also expand,
it may rupture when the water
freezes. Iron pipe and steel pipe
do not expand appreciably. Copper pipe will stretch some, but
does not resume its original dimensions when thawed out;
repeated freezings will cause it to
fail eventually. Flexible plastic
tubing can stand repeated freezes, but it is good practice to
prevent it from freezing.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Preventing_Freezing" name="Preventing_Freezing"></a>Preventing Freezing</p>

<p>Pipes may be insulated to prevent freezing, but this is not a
completely dependable method.
Insulation does not stop the loss
of heat from the pipe&mdash;merely
slows it down&mdash;and the water
may freeze if it stands in the
pipe long enough at below-freezing temperature. Also, if the
insulation becomes wet, it may
lose its effectiveness.</p>

<p>Electric heating cable can be
used to prevent pipes from freezing. The cable should be wrapped
around the pipe and covered with
insulation.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Thawing" name="Thawing"></a>Thawing</p>

<p>Use of electric heating cable is
a good method of thawing frozen
pipe, because the entire heated
length of the pipe is thawed at
one time.</p>

<p>Thawing pipe with a blowtorch can be dangerous. The
water may get hot enough at the
point where the torch is applied
to generate sufficient steam under
pressure to rupture the pipe.
Steam from the break could severely scald you.</p>

<p>Thawing pipe with hot water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"> 9 </a></span>
is safer than thawing with a blowtorch. One method is to cover the
pipe with rags and then pour the
hot water over the rags.</p>

<p>When thawing pipe with a
blowtorch, hot water, or similar
methods, open a faucet and start
thawing at that point. The open
faucet will permit steam to escape, thus reducing the chance of
the buildup of dangerous pressure. Do not allow the steam to
condense and refreeze before it
reaches the faucet.</p>

<p>Underground metal pipes can
be thawed by passing a low-voltage electric current through them.
The current will heat the entire
length of pipe through which it
passes. Both ends of the pipe must
be open to prevent the buildup of
steam pressure.</p>

<p>CAUTION: This method of thawing frozen pipe can be dangerous
and should be done by an experienced person only. It cannot be
used to thaw plastic tubing or
other non-electricity-conducting
pipe or tubing.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="REPAIRING_WATER_CLOSETS" id="REPAIRING_WATER_CLOSETS">REPAIRING WATER CLOSETS</a></p>


<p>Water closets (commonly called
toilets) vary in general design
and in the design of the flushing
mechanism. But they are enough
alike that general repair instructions can suffice for all designs.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Flushing_Mechanism" name="Flushing_Mechanism"></a>Flushing Mechanism</p>

<p><a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a> shows a common type
of flushing mechanism. Parts that
usually require repair are the
flush valve, the intake (float)
valve, and the float ball.</p>

<p>In areas of corrosive water, the
usual copper flushing mechanism
may deteriorate in a comparatively short time. In such cases,
it may be advisable to replace
the corroded parts with plastic
parts. You can even buy plastic
float balls.</p>

<p class="caption4"><i>Flush Valve</i></p>

<p>The rubber ball of the flush
valve may get soft or out of shape
and fail to seat properly. This
causes the valve to leak. Unscrew
the ball from the lift wire and
install a new one.</p>

<p>The trip lever or lift wire may
corrode and fail to work smoothly, or the lift wire may bind in
the guides. Disassemble and clean
off corrosion or replace parts as
necessary.</p>

<p>Most plumbing codes require a
cutoff valve in the supply line to
the flush tank, which makes it
unnecessary to close down the
whole system (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>). If this
valve was not installed, you can
stop the flow of water by propping up the float with a piece of
wood. Be careful not to bend the
float rod out of alignment.</p>

<p class="caption4"><i>Intake (Float) Valve</i></p>

<p>A worn plunger washer in the
supply valve will cause the valve
to leak. To replace the washer&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"> 10 </a></span></p>

<ul>

<li>Shut off the water and drain
the tank.</li>

<li>Unscrew the two thumb-screws that hold the levers and
push out the levers.</li>

<li>Lift out the plunger, unscrew the cup on the bottom, and
insert a new washer. The washer
is made of material such as rubber or leather.</li>

<li>Examine the washer seat.
If nicked or rough, it may need
refacing.</li>

</ul>

<p>If the float-valve assembly is
badly corroded, replace it.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><i>Figure 7.</i>&mdash;Water closet (toilet) flush tank.</div>
</div>

<p class="caption4"><i>Float Ball</i></p>

<p>The float ball may develop a
leak and fail to rise to the proper
position. (Correct water level is
about 1 inch below the top of the
overflow tube or enough to give
a good flush.) If the ball fails
to rise, the intake valve will remain open and water will
continue to flow. Brass float balls
can sometimes be drained and the
leak soldered. Other types must
be replaced. When working on the
float ball, be careful to keep the
rod aliened so that the ball will
float freely and close the valve
properly.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Bowl_Removal" name="Bowl_Removal"></a>Bowl Removal</p>

<p>An obstruction in the water
closet trap or leakage around the
bottom of the water-closet bowl
may require removal of the bowl.
Follow this procedure:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"> 11 </a></span></p>

<ul>

<li>Shut off the water.</li>

<li>Empty the tank and bowl
by siphoning or sponging out the
water.</li>

<li>Disconnect the water pipes
to the tank (see <a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>).</li>

<li>Disconnect the tank from
the bowl if the water closet is
a two-piece unit. Set the tank
where it cannot be damaged.
Handle tank and bowl carefully;
they are made of vitreous china
or porcelain and are easily chipped or broken.</li>

<li>Remove the seat and cover
from the bowl.</li>

<li>Carefully pry loose the bolt
covers and remove the bolts
holding the bowl to the floor
flange (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>). Jar the bowl
enough to break the seal at the
bottom. Set the bowl upside down
on something that will not chip
or break it.</li>

<li>Remove the obstruction
from the discharge opening.</li>

<li>Place a new wax seal around
the bowl horn and press it into
place. A wax seal (or gasket) may
be obtained from hardware or
plumbing-supply stores.</li>

<li>Set the bowl in place and
press it down firmly. Install the
bolts that hold it to the
floor flange. Draw the bolts up
snugly, but not too tight because
the bowl may break. The bowl
must be level. Keep a carpenter's
level on it while drawing up the
bolts. If the house has settled,
leaving the floor sloping, it may
be necessary to use shims to make
the bowl set level. Replace the
bolt covers.</li>

<li>Install the tank and connect
the water pipes to it. It is
advisable to replace all gaskets,
after first cleaning the surfaces
thoroughly.</li>

<li>Test for leaks by flushing
a few times.</li>

<li>Install the seat and cover.</li>

</ul>

<p class="caption3"><a id="Tank_Sweating" name="Tank_Sweating"></a>Tank "Sweating"</p>

<p>When cold water enters a
water closet tank, it may chill
the tank enough to cause "sweating" (condensation of atmospheric
moisture on the outer surface
of the tank). This can be prevented by insulating the tank to
keep the temperature of the outer
surface above the dew point temperature of surrounding air.
Insulating jackets or liners that fit
inside water-closet tanks and
serve to keep the outer surface
warm are available from plumbing-supply dealers.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="CLEARING_CLOGGED_DRAINS" id="CLEARING_CLOGGED_DRAINS">CLEARING CLOGGED DRAINS</a></p>


<p>Drains may become clogged by
objects dropped into them or by
accumulations of grease, dirt, or
other matter.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Fixture_and_Floor_Drains" name="Fixture_and_Floor_Drains"></a>Fixture and Floor Drains</p>

<p>If the obstruction is in a fixture trap, usually the trap can
be removed and cleared. If the
obstruction is elsewhere in the
pipe other means must be used.</p>

<p>Cleanout augers&mdash;long, flexible, steel cables commonly called
"snakes"&mdash;may be run down
drainpipes to break up obstructions or to hook onto and pull
out objects. Augers are made in
various lengths and diameters
and are available at hardware and
plumbing-supply stores. (In some
cases, you may have to call a
plumber, who will probably have
a power-driven auger.)</p>

<p>Small obstructions can sometimes be forced down or drawn
up by use of an ordinary rubber
force cup (plunger or "plumber's
friend").</p>

<p>Grease and soap clinging to a
pipe can sometimes be removed
by flushing with hot water. Lye
or lye mixed with a small amount
of aluminum shavings may also
be used. When water is added to
the mixture, the violent gas-forming reaction and production of
heat that takes place loosens the
grease and soap so that they can
be flushed away. Use cold water
only. Chemical cleaners should
not be used in pipes that are
completely stopped up, because
they must be brought into direct
contact with the stoppage to be
effective. Handle the material
with extreme care and follow directions on the container. If lye
spills on the hands or clothing,
wash with cold water immediately. If any gets into the eyes, flush
with cold water and call a doctor.</p>

<p>Sand, dirt, or clothing lint
sometimes clogs floor drains. Remove the strainer and ladle out
as much of the sediment as possible. You may have to carefully
chip away the concrete around
the strainer to free it. Flush the
drain with clean water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"> 13 </a></span></p>

<p>When drains have become partially clogged due to lack of water
to transport all solids through
them, large buckets or other containers should be used to flush
them. Water should be poured fast
enough to nearly fill the drain.</p>

<p>Occasional flushing of floor
drains may prevent clogging.</p>

<p><b>CAUTION: Augers, rubber
force cups, and other tools used in
direct contact with sewage are
subject to contamination. Do not
later use them for work on your
potable water supply system unless they have been properly
sterilized.</b></p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Outside_Drains" name="Outside_Drains"></a>Outside Drains</p>

<p>Roots growing through cracks
or defective joints sometimes
clog outside drains or sewers.
You can clear the stoppage temporarily by using a root-cutting
tool. However, to prevent future
trouble, you should re-lay the defective portion of the line, using
sound pipe and making sure that
all joints are watertight.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Basic tools that you should
have on hand to make simple
plumbing repairs include:</p>

<p class="smaller">Wrenches, including pipe wrenches,
in a range of sizes to fit the pipe, fittings, fixtures, equipment,
and appliances in the system.</p>

<p class="smaller">Screwdrivers in a range of sizes to
fit the faucets, valves, and other parts
of the system.</p>

<p class="smaller">Ball peen hammer or a 12- or 16-ounce clawhammer.</p>

<p class="smaller">Rubber force cup (plunger or
"plumber's friend").</p>

<p class="smaller">Cold chisel and center punch.</p>

<p class="smaller">Cleanout auger ("snake").</p>

<p class="smaller">Friction tape.</p>

<p class="smaller">Adjustable pliers.</p>

<p>Additional tools required for
more extensive plumbing repairs
include:</p>

<p class="smaller">Pipe vise.</p>

<p class="smaller">Set of pipe threading dies and stocks.</p>

<p class="smaller">Hacksaw and blades (blades should
have 32 teeth per inch).</p>

<p class="smaller">Pipe cutter, roller type.</p>

<p class="smaller">Tapered reamer or half-round file.</p>

<p class="smaller">Carpenter's brace.</p>

<p class="smaller">Set of wood bits.</p>

<p class="smaller">Gasoline blowtorch.</p>

<p class="smaller">Lead pot and ladle.</p>

<p class="smaller">Calking tools.</p>

<p class="smaller">Copper tube cutter with reamer (if
you have copper tubing).</p>

<p>Always use the proper size
wrench or screwdriver. Do not
use pipe wrenches on nuts with
flat surfaces; use an adjustable
or open-end wrench. Do not use
pipe wrenches on polished-surface tubings or fittings, such as
found on plumbing fixtures; use
a strap wrench. Tight nuts or
fittings can sometimes be loosened by tapping lightly with a
hammer or mallet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"> 14 </a></span></p>

<p>It should not be necessary to
stock a large number of spare
parts. Past plumbing troubles
may give some indication as to
the kind of parts most likely to
be needed. Spare parts should include:</p>

<p class="smaller">Faucet washers and packing.</p>

<p class="smaller">One or two lengths of the most
common type and size of piping in the
plumbing system.</p>

<p class="smaller">Several unions and gaskets or unions
with ground surfaces.</p>

<p class="smaller">Several couplings and elbows.</p>

<p class="smaller">A few feet of pipe strap.</p>

<p class="smaller">An extra hose connection.</p>

<p>Grouped below are emergencies that may occur and the action
to take. The name, address, and
phone number of a plumber who
offers 24-hour service should be
posted in a conspicuous place.</p>

<p><i>Burst pipe or tank.</i>&mdash;Immediately cut off the flow of water
by closing the shutoff valve nearest to the break. Then arrange
for repair.</p>

<p><i>Water closet overflow.</i>&mdash;Do not
use water closet until back in
working order. Check for and remove stoppage in closet bowl
outlet, drain line from closet to sewer, or sewer or septic tank. If
stoppage is due to root entry into
pipe, repair of pipe at that point
is recommended.</p>

<p><i>Rumbling noise in hot water
tank.</i>&mdash;This is likely a sign of
overheating which could lead to
the development of explosive pressure (Another indication of
overheating is hot water backing
up in the cold-water supply pipe.)
Cut off the burner immediately.
Be sure that the pressure-relief
valve is operative. Then check
(with a thermometer) the temperature of the water at the
nearest outlet. If above that for which
the gage is set, check the thermostat that controls burner
cutoff. If you cannot correct the
trouble, call a plumber.</p>

<p><i>Cold house.</i>&mdash;If the heating
system fails (or if you close the
house and turn off the heat)
when there is a chance of subfreezing weather, completely
drain the plumbing system. A
drain valve is usually provided at
the low point of the water supply piping for this purpose. A
pump, storage tank, hot-water
tank, water closet tank, water-treatment apparatus, and other
water-system appliances or accessories should also be drained.
Put antifreeze in all fixture and
drain traps.</p>

<p>Hot-water and steam heating
systems should also be drained
when the house temperature
may drop below freezing.</p>

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
